PGPPwdTool
==========

An HTML5 app to locally store a PGP encrypted password list. The basic idea is to use HTML5 localstorage to store a list of encrypted passwords. The app will generate a set of PGP keys to handle the encryption and the app will allow the data to be exported/imported through an external file.
